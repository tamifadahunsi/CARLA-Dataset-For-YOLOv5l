# CARLA-Dataset-For-YOLOv5l
This repository contains an image and dataset implemented to train a YOLO5vl model to perform object detection on class objects of vehicle, pedestrian, traffic light, motorcyclist, speed limit, stop sign, cyclist, road sign as seen in the simulator environment.
dataset is a combination self-generated images and images procured from digital repository. (359) images of the dataset have been extracted from a larger dataset found here: https://github.com/DanielHfnr/Carla-Object-Detection-Dataset.
These images have all been resized to 640 x 640 pixels and self annotated (labelled).
