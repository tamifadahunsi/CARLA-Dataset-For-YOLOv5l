# CARLA-Dataset-For-YOLOv5l
This repository contains an image and label dataset implemented to train a YOLO5vl model to perform object detection on class objects of vehicle, pedestrian, traffic light, motorcyclist, speed limit, stop sign, cyclist, road sign as seen in the simulator environment. The dataset containing 1,124 images is a combination self-generated images and images procured from digital repository. (359) Images of the dataset have been extracted from a larger GitHub repository by DanielHfnr found here: https://github.com/DanielHfnr/Carla-Object-Detection-Dataset. The self-generated dataset was collected in Carla Simulator, driving around in autopilot mode in various environments (Town01, Town02, Town03, Town04, Town05, Town06, Town07, Town08, Town09, Town10) and saving every 20 seconds. The traiing dataset has been further divded into 901 '.jpg' images, each with their corresponding labels in the form of textfirles. The valiation set is comprised of the remaining 223 images and labels in the same format.,   The labels where then automatically generated using the semantic segmentation information. All images have all been resized to 640 x 640 pixels and self annotated (labelled).
