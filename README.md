# CARLA-Dataset-For-YOLOv5l
This repository contains an image and dataset implemented to train a YOLO5vl model to perform object detection on class objects of vehicle, pedestrian, traffic light, motorcyclist, speed limit, stop sign, cyclist, road sign as seen in the simulator environment.
dataset is a combination self-generated images and images procured from digital repository. (359) images of the dataset have been extracted from a larger GitHub repository by DanielHfnr found here: https://github.com/DanielHfnr/Carla-Object-Detection-Dataset. The self-generated dataset was collected in Carla Simulator, driving around in autopilot mode in various environments (Town01, Town02, Town03, Town04, Town05, Town06, Town07, Town08, Town09, Town10) and saving every 20 seconds. The labels where then automatically generated using the semantic segmentation information.
These images have all been resized to 640 x 640 pixels and self annotated (labelled).
